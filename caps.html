                <h2>What do we do?</h2>
                <p>University Health & Counseling (UHC) supports the health and well-being of the campus community. We
                    are
                    inspired to help students realize their potential, cope with the stresses of life, work
                    productively,
                    and connect meaningfully with others.</p>
                <p>UHC is made up of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), which offers counseling services, and
                    University Health Service (UHS), which offers medical services. This website is about CAPS. For
                    information about UHS, please visit the <a href=https://uhs.umich.edu>UHS website.</a></p>
                <p>CAPS is committed to creating an environment based on our values of multicultural, multi-disciplinary
                    and
                    multi-theoretical practices that allow our diverse student body to access care, receive high quality
                    services and take positive pathways to mental health. We are happy to offer both in-person and
                    virtual
                    services. </p>

                    and
                    Gaza. We recognize the understandable grief, fear and anger that many of our students may be
                    experiencing right now, especially our students who are Israeli, Palestinian, or have ties to or
                    loved
                    ones in those regions. We encourage all of you to take care of and be compassionate with yourselves
                    and
                    each other; it is in times like these, that we can come together as a community, and in fact, we

                <p>When faced with social injustices and bias incidents, it is extremely difficult to cope and know what
                    to
                    do. Feeling overwhelmed with the current socio-political state, experiencing discrimination, or
                    being
                    impacted by contentious people or policies increases stress which remains correlated to negative
                    mental
                    health outcomes. During these times, it remains imperative that we take care of ourselves, take care
                    of
                    loved ones, and take care of our campus community. We all have the power to spread kindness,
                    celebrate
                    diversity and inclusion, and promote social justice.</p>
