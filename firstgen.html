            <h3>Am I a first-generation college student?</h3>
            <p>At the University of Michigan, undergraduates and graduate students are considered first-generation
                college students if neither parent or guardian has completed a 4-year college or university degree.
                <br>This definition includes students with other family members (siblings, cousins, grandparents, etc.)
                who have completed a four-year degree. </p>
